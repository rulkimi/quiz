# Quiz Website

This is a simple quiz website project that I created for practice. The project is designed to help me improve my web development skills by implementing a quiz interface. I took inspiration from a YouTube video and made some modifications to customize it to my needs.

## Features

- HSK4 Quiz: The website focuses on HSK4 (Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì) vocabulary, providing a quiz to test your knowledge of Chinese language proficiency.
- Responsive Design: The website is built with a responsive design, ensuring it looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
- Dynamic Question Display: The main question and answer options are dynamically loaded onto the page, creating an interactive quiz experience.
- Scoring: The website keeps track of your score as you progress through the quiz.
- Restart Quiz: If you'd like to retake the quiz, there's a restart button available.

## Credits

I would like to acknowledge the inspiration I gained from a YouTube video tutorial, which provided the foundation for this project. While I made certain modifications to suit my needs, the core idea came from ASMR Programming - Coding a Quiz Game | No Talking by Developete.
